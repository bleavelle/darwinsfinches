# DARWIN'S FINCHES
analysis of finch dataset from Kaggle

## I LOVE EVOLUTION.
Before I got into data analysis, I was a philosophy and biology major. Im also a bird photographer, so I read about birds and evolution all the time, and talk about it constanty with my friends. When I found this Finch dataset on Kaggle, I was so psyched. I had heard of this couple in ornithology courses, and know all about Darwin and his beloved finches. SO, I had to play with this data set... how fun to be able to use raw data to come to the same conclusions that Darwin did way back in the early 19th century? What a hoot! <br> <br>
